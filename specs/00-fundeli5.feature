Feature: FundEli5
  A relationship manager asks the fund dealing desk whether a portfolio may
  subscribe to a fund. FundEli5 answers in seconds with a Verdict (Eligible,
  Not Eligible or Needs Review), a Justification that cites the Fund
  Documentation page behind every rule, and a reply the Fund Dealer can send,
  explained so plainly that the relationship manager can forward it to the
  client. An LLM drafts the Rule Cards and the reply; a person validates every
  Rule Card; deterministic code decides every Verdict. Client identity never
  reaches the LLM, and every check leaves an audit record.

  Read the features in this order:
    01 Check eligibility                 what decides a Verdict, rule by rule
    02 Answer a subscription request     email in, cited reply out, privacy kept
    03 Explain a Verdict                 the plain-language explanation and "what would make it eligible?"
    04 Find what a portfolio can buy     the reverse lookup across every Share Class
    05 Prepare the subscription form     the checklist of declarations and documents
    06 Validate a Rule Card              from a drafted card to one that may decide
    07 Audit a check                     the Check Record
    99 Answer key                        the 26 coverage-set rows with every rule outcome
