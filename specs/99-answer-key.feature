Feature: Answer key
  The coverage set: every check the demo data must produce, with the Verdict and
  the outcome of every rule. Each row also appears, as an example, under the
  Rule it proves in 01-check-eligibility.feature and 02-answer-a-subscription-request.feature.
  Rerun before every rehearsal; every row must pass before the demo is rehearsed.

  Rule columns: investor category, US Person exclusion, minimum initial
  subscription, mandate-only class, KID required for retail, Unmodelled
  Restrictions, Target Market, Fund Registration. "—" means the card has no
  such rule, or, on rows 24 and 25, that no rule is evaluated. Rows 4 to 9 are
  Tom's reverse lookup.

  Background:
    Given the demo dataset
    And the Validated Rule Cards of the sample funds
    And Nordea's "reject or close" clause and the SIF's "at AIFM discretion" clause are marked Noted

  Scenario Outline: Row <row> - <shows>
    When <portfolio> asks to subscribe <amount> to <class>, client initiated: <initiated>
    Then the Verdict is <verdict>
    And the rule outcomes are:
      | investor category   | <category>     |
      | US Person exclusion | <us person>    |
      | minimum             | <minimum>      |
      | mandate-only class  | <mandate>      |
      | KID for retail      | <kid>          |
      | Unmodelled          | <unmodelled>   |
      | Target Market       | <target market> |
      | Fund Registration   | <registration> |
