# PROTOTYPE: Rule Card extraction on Spring Boot 4, Spring AI, Java 25

Throwaway spike for [ticket #31](https://github.com/smnajid/fund-gate/issues/31). It ports the Python spike from [#7](https://github.com/smnajid/fund-gate/issues/7) (branch `prototype/rule-card-extraction`) to the hackathon stack. It runs on the same fund, against the same gold Rule Card, with the same scoring. Not hackathon product code.

## Run

```bash
# fetch the Nordea 1 GCE prospectus + 2 KIDs into docs/ (gitignored); URLs in docs/research/sample-funds.md
./run.sh --check-gold        # PDFBox text: every gold quote on its page, Jev's 25 pages cover the gold pages
./run.sh --dry-run           # Jev page selection and "possibly missed" coverage only, no LLM
./run.sh --pages=3,5,16,123,124,134,138,139,146 --label=gold-pages   # Claude plan (headless claude -p)
./run.sh --label=auto        # the 25 pages Jev choice selects (--max-pages=N to change)
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=spring-ai ./run.sh --label=api   # Anthropic API / Foundry; needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
./run.sh --score             # rescore the latest run
./run.sh --recall=page-recall-key-unseen.json   # page recall of Jev's selection, no LLM
./run.sh --dry-run --fundeli5.fund-id=robeco    # robeco | bgf: the other two funds with a gold card
```

Jev needs `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` unless the ranking is cached (`fundeli5.jev.cache-dir`, default `jev-rankings/`). Each run
writes `runs/<stamp>-<label>.json` (the Draft Rule Card plus usage) and a `.md` score.

**The Claude-plan drafter is for public documents only.** It runs on your personal claude.ai plan, even when
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is exported, and the plan's terms are not the bank's. Put a confidential PPM, side letter or
bank-internal document through `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=spring-ai` on the bank's approved endpoint. Never port
`ClaudePlanDrafter` to the online dealer runtime ([ADR 0004](../../docs/adr/0004-two-runtimes-one-llm-egress.md)).

**Page selection is Jev only since 2026-10-17** (ticket #39): choice selects, with the page before its top pages, and
per page flags "possibly missed". Keyword selection v1 (`PageSelection`) and v2 (`PageSelectionV2`), `--v2`, `--sweep`,
`--select` and `--jev-prev` are gone; the results sections below keep the commands as they were run. The last commit
with them is `5a06179`. Per page alone was tried as the selector and dropped: at 40 pages it still missed Robeco p.243
(target market, 0.97 but ranked 46th behind other sub-funds' target market pages) and BlackRock p.156, and coverage
flagged neither.

## Results (2026-10-12, Claude plan, Opus 5.5)

| Run | Prospectus pages | Rules found | Correct values | Quotes on the cited page | Time | Cost* |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| hand-picked pages | 9 | 18/18 | 18/18 | 38/38 | 82 s | $0.62 |
| automatic page selection | 27 of 944 | 18/18 | 18/18 | 38/38 | 131 s | $1.81 |
| automatic, with a sub-fund name bug (23 pages) | 23 | 18/18 | 18/18 | 35/35 | 78 s | $0.96 |

\* Claude Code's list-price estimate, not a bill. Both traps handled every time (mandate-only BI avoided, KID-vs-prospectus contradiction flagged). Same scores as the Python spike's best run.

- PDFBox replaces pypdf: all 24 gold quotes found on their page, 944 pages to text in 5.5 s, auto scope = 27 pages, as in Python.
- The Spring AI adapter compiles and wires (`spring-ai` profile) but was **not run live**: no API credits.
- Spring AI 2.0.1's Anthropic module sits on the official Anthropic Java SDK and supports PDF documents with Citations (`AnthropicCitationDocument`) and structured output (`outputSchema`). But `ChatModel` joins all text blocks and returns citations as one flat metadata list, so it loses which passage supports which statement. Pass 1 therefore calls `AnthropicChatModel.getAnthropicClient()` (the SDK client Spring AI configured) directly; pass 2 uses `ChatModel`.

## Page recall on unseen documents (ticket #32, 2026-10-12, no LLM)

`./run.sh --recall` scores `PageSelection` against `page-recall-key.json` (page plus a quote that must sit on it, per
Hard Restriction; the funds' PDFs are downloaded into `docs/` from the URLs in `docs/research/sample-funds.md` on
`research/sample-funds`). `./run.sh --sweep` runs every Nordea 1 sub-fund (`nordea1-subfunds.json`) against the shared
rule pages 3, 5, 123, 124, 138 plus its own description page.

- Before the fixes: 25/26 pages over 9 documents (Nordea 1, Nordea SIF GPE, BNP (CH) Bonds CHF in EN and FR, 4 KIDs,
  Swiss Life iFunds). The one miss: Swiss Life p.2, the FINMA exemption that says there is no KID (no Target Market
  source). The French prospectus scored 4/4 with English keywords (fund name + "restrict"); the KIDs are 3 pages.
- Sweep: 89/89 Nordea 1 sub-funds keep every expected page, 25–32 pages each.
- Fund-name spelling is the real weak point: "Global Climate & Environment Fund" or a share-class suffix silently drops
  the sub-fund's own description page. Now a hard error on documents over 100 pages.
- Front matter (pages 1–5) is now always kept: it fixes the Swiss Life miss. After both fixes: 26/26.
- Small documents barely shrink (BNP 26 of 34 pages, Swiss Life 14 of 47, SIF 18 of 63); selection only pays on umbrellas.
- `QuoteCheck` normalised whitespace with Java `\s`, which misses the no-break spaces French typesetting uses
  ("1 000 000", "n’y a pas"); true French quotes failed. Now `[\s\p{Z}]`.

### 20 unseen fund documents (ticket #32, follow-up)

`page-recall-key-unseen.json`: 22 documents downloaded into `docs/x-*.pdf` (not committed; URLs in `unseen-sources.txt`),
12 publishers (Allianz GI, Amundi/Lyxor, BlackRock ×2, Candriam EN+FR, UBP, Swiss Rock, DWS ×2, JPMorgan ×2,
La Française, M&G, Pictet DE, Robeco DE, Vontobel CH+LU, Swisscanto KID DE, Schroders, Goldman Sachs). One sub-fund
per umbrella; per rule kind (description, US Person, share-class eligibility, minimum, sometimes Target Market) the
page with a quote verified on it, plus `alt` pages that state the same rule. Key pages were found with different,
multilingual searches from the selector's keywords and confirmed by reading the snippet.

| | v1 (`PageSelection`, Nordea-tuned) | v2 (`spike/PageSelectionV2`, `--v2`) |
|---|---|---|
| unseen, 19 docs with text, 74 rules | **40/74**; 7 docs stop at the name guard | **72/74** at 40 pages |
| demo set, 9 docs, 35 rules | 35/35 | 35/35 |
| scope, unseen | 10–40 | 3–40 (median ~28) |

- v1 is Nordea-tuned: "own page" = name in the first 400 chars next to English "investment objective"; DE/FR and
  other layouts never match, and its English keywords miss "Minimum Subscription", "Class X … reserved",
  "Mindestzeichnung".
- v2: front matter; sub-fund section = first page where the name is followed by an objective/currency heading
  (EN/DE/FR), plus 3 pages; the 10 pages naming it most; then pages ranked by the number of **distinct** EN/DE/FR
  rule keywords (counting occurrences let AGIF's repeated "Investment Restrictions" table crowd out the rule pages).
  Designed after seeing v1's failures on this set, so 72/74 is optimistic.
- Nordea 1 sweep with v2: 89/89 sub-funds, 40 pages each.
- v2 misses: AGIF p.26 "3.3 Minimum Investment Amount" (one keyword only) and BlackRock BGF's description page (no
  heading after the name; its rule pages were all found).
- 2 of 21 PDFs have **no text layer** (Schroders 1,428 pp, GS supplement): no keyword selection and no quote check is
  possible; they need OCR first (Document Intelligence, #13's pass 0).

## Page selection by Jev (ticket #39, 2026-10-16)

[TypeSafe Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction) ranks the pages for each of six rule kinds: the sub-fund's own
description, US Person, investor eligibility, minimum, target market, other restriction. Then the same selection as the
Elasticsearch prototype: pages 1–5, then round-robin over the six rankings until the budget is used. Documents no longer
than the budget are sent whole. `spike/JevClient`, `spike/JevPageRanking`; rankings cached in `jev-rankings/`, so other
budgets cost nothing.

- **jev-page**: one request per page, one yes/no (noul) question per rule kind, the page as state. Scores compare across
  the whole document. This is the pattern of JEV's own RAG-classification and re-ranking cookbooks.
- **jev-choice**: per rule kind, a choice question whose options are the pages plus "none". A question holds about 20
  pages (32k tokens), so the pages play a knockout: the top 3 of each batch go on until one batch is left.

Rule recall (pages selected, summed over the documents with text):

| budget | set | v2 (keywords) | jev-page | jev-choice |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 40 | demo, 35 rules | 35/35 | 35/35 | 35/35 |
| 40 | unseen, 74 rules | 72/74 | **74/74** | **74/74** |
| 25 | demo | 35/35 (104 p) | 35/35 (137 p) | 35/35 (137 p) |
| 25 | unseen | 69/74 (416 p) | 73/74 (453 p) | **74/74** (453 p) |
| 15 | demo | 31/35 (82 p) | **35/35** (87 p) | 34/35 (87 p) |
| 15 | unseen | 50/74 (279 p) | 69/74 (273 p) | **71/74** (273 p) |
| 10 | demo | 29/35 (80 p) | **31/35** (62 p) | 30/35 (62 p) |
| 10 | unseen | 36/74 (239 p) | 60/74 (183 p) | **67/74** (183 p) |

| | jev-page | jev-choice |
|---|---|---|
| cost, all 27 documents (~8,000 pages) | $0.40 | $1.84 |
| cost, Nordea prospectus (944 pages) | $0.05, 944 requests, 32 s | $0.20, 328 requests, 18 s |
| tokens per page | ~1,250 (state counted once for 6 questions) | ~5,000 (6 questions, plus later rounds) |

- Both Jev variants beat the keywords at every budget, and the gap grows as the budget shrinks: at 15 pages the
  keywords lose 24 of 74 rules, Jev loses 3–5. v2 was tuned on the unseen set; the Jev questions were written once from
  the rule kinds and not tuned. v2's fixed parts (front matter, 4 section pages, 10 name pages) eat a small budget.
- German and French pages were not a problem at 25 pages or more, despite the docs saying English is Jev's best language.
  Several of the 10-page misses are DE (Mindestzeichnung, Anlegerart).
- **jev-choice** ranks better (74/74 at 25 pages), at about 4–5× the tokens of jev-page. At these prices both are noise
  next to the Citations call ($1–2 per Nordea run).
- **jev-page**'s one miss at 25 pages: JPMorgan's US Person rule (p.45, also stated on pp. 292 and 303; none selected).
- Remaining misses are tables that only make sense with their heading on the page before (JPMorgan p.280 "base share
  classes", Amundi p.81 minimums) and Nordea p.138 at 10–15 pages.
- No text layer still means no selection (Schroders, GS supplement): Jev reads text, OCR first.

### Recommendation (2026-10-16)

Adopt **Jev choice** to select the pages (best recall at every budget, the only variant tested end to end) and keep
**Jev per page** as a cheap extra pass: per rule kind, the best per-page score among the selected pages; under 0.5 is a
"possibly missed" candidate for the validation screen. Both: about $0.25 per 944-page prospectus.
`./run.sh --select=jev-choice --max-pages=25` does both before extraction (`--dry-run` stops before the LLM).

Method 1 (every part of the prospectus through Citations) was not run: Jev already finds 74/74, and Method 1 would send
about 38× more pass-1 input on Nordea (944 pages at ~600 tokens vs 25) and risks rules from other sub-funds. If Jev
is not allowed as a second vendor (#5), fall back to keywords v2 at 40 pages (72/74).

### End to end on Nordea: Rule Card from Jev's pages (2026-10-16, Claude plan, Opus 5.5)

Jev choice's 25 pages (`--pages=1,2,3,4,5,6,16,67,106,123,124,131,136,137,138,210,248,249,857,859,860,861,880,936,944
--label=jev-choice-25`), same drafter and gold card as the runs above:

| Run | Prospectus pages | Rules found | Correct values | Quotes on the cited page | Time | Cost* |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| hand-picked pages | 9 | 18/18 | 18/18 | 38/38 | 82 s | $0.62 |
| keyword selection (v1) | 27 of 944 | 18/18 | 18/18 | 38/38 | 131 s | $1.81 |
| **Jev choice, 25 pages** | 25 of 944 | **18/18** | **18/18** | **40/40** | 90 s | $1.00 + $0.20 Jev |

\* Claude Code's list-price estimate, not a bill. Both traps handled (mandate-only BI avoided, KID-vs-prospectus
contradiction flagged). Jev's pages skip three of the nine hand-picked pages (134, 139, 146),
but the gold card cites none of them: it cites prospectus pages 3, 5, 123, 124 and 138, all in Jev's 25. This run cited
those plus 16, 136 and 137, and KID pages 1 and 3. One run on one fund: the Citations API path (`spring-ai` profile) is still untested
live.

### End to end on the Citations API (2026-10-16, Anthropic API)

`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=spring-ai ./run.sh --select=jev-choice --max-pages=25 --label=citations-jev-choice-25`: Jev
choice's 25 pages, pass 1 Opus 5.5 with PDFs and Citations, pass 2 Sonnet 5.5 with structured output. First live run of
`SpringAiCitationsDrafter`.

| | Rules found | Correct values | Quotes on the cited page | Time | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Citations API, Jev choice 25 pages | **18/18** | **18/18** | **45/45** | 149 s | $0.21 (cache read) |

- Coverage pass flagged nothing: every rule kind has a selected page scoring 0.87–0.96.
- Both traps handled (mandate-only BI avoided, KID-vs-prospectus contradiction flagged). Four Unmodelled Restrictions,
  including market timing, which the Claude-plan runs did not list.
- **First live run failed silently**: pass 1 cited 39 passages, pass 2 wrote 5.7k tokens, but the drafter parsed only
  `getResult()` and saved a 0-rule card ($0.68, kept in `runs/` as `20261016-230854`). Fixed: every generation is
  searched, and a missing card now fails with the raw text in `runs/pass2-unparsed.txt`.
- The cost is real API billing. Pass 1 re-read the cached PDFs (100k tokens at the cache-read price), so a cold run
  costs about $0.68: Opus pass 1 $0.61, Sonnet pass 2 $0.07.
- Scorer change: BP's minimum came back as amount 0 with no currency, which is right (the prospectus says "None") but
  was scored wrong because gold expected "EUR". `gold-rule-card.json` now accepts no currency for that rule; every
  earlier run keeps its score.

### Does Jev repeat itself? (2026-10-16)

Every unseen document was ranked a second time (`jev-rankings-rerun/`, `--jev-cache=jev-rankings-rerun`, about $1.75 of
Jev). The order of pages changes a little between runs (top 10 pages per rule kind mostly the same, swapped around), so
recall moves at small budgets:

| budget | jev-page run 1 / run 2 | jev-choice run 1 / run 2 |
|---|---|---|
| 25 | 73/74 / 73/74 | **74/74 / 74/74** |
| 15 | 69/74 / 70/74 | 71/74 / 70/74 |
| 10 | 60/74 / 62/74 | 67/74 / 63/74 |

At 25 pages both runs agree exactly. Below that, choice's lead is partly noise: at 10 pages it is 7 rules in run 1 and
1 rule in run 2.

**BlackRock p.156, missed both times.** It is the only page saying "Class A Shares are available to all investors"
(gold rule category-A). It ranks about #30–40 for investor eligibility in choice and #14 (score ~0.5) per page, in both
runs. The page is mostly another sub-fund's description (World Technology Fund); the "Classes and Form of Shares"
section starts at character 4,456 of 6,124. Jev judges the page as a whole, so a rule in the last quarter of a mixed
page ranks low. Not a cut-off: pages are sent up to 6,000 characters (627 of 7,980 pages are longer and are cut).

### Two more funds end to end: Robeco (DE) and BlackRock BGF (EN) (2026-10-16, Citations API)

`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=spring-ai ./run.sh --fundeli5.fund-id=robeco|bgf --select=jev-choice --jev-prev --max-pages=25`.
Prospectus only (no KIDs downloaded). Gold cards in `gold/`, drafted from the page text and checked against a blind
answer key written by a separate Claude agent that saw only the two prospectuses: every scored rule agreed. Not yet
checked by a person.

`--jev-prev` adds the page before Jev's top pages in the first two rounds. It was added because Jev missed BlackRock
p.156 in both Jev runs (Class A "available to all investors" at the bottom of another sub-fund's page). With it all gold
pages of the three funds are selected; the cost is budget: unseen recall at 25 pages 74/74 and 73/74 over the two Jev
runs (Amundi's minimum lost in run 2), at 15 pages 68 and 64 (without: 71 and 70).

| Fund | Rules found | Correct values | Quotes on the cited page | Trap | Time | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Robeco Smart Energy (DE, 545 pp) | 8/8 | **8/8** | 29/31, really 31/31 (see below) | mandate-only I avoided | 83 s | $0.62 |
| BlackRock Global Allocation (EN, 724 pp) | 6/6 | **4/6** | 33/33 | mandate-only I avoided | 144 s | $0.20 |

- Coverage pass flagged nothing on either fund.
- **BlackRock US Person, "wrong" on both classes**: the model set `excludes_us_citizens` to null ("whether US citizenship
  alone excludes an investor is not stated"), gold says false. The prospectus defines US Person as "any US resident or
  other person specified in Regulation S", which is residence-based, but never says so about citizens in words. A
  defensible "unclear" for the validator rather than a misreading; gold is left unchanged.
- BlackRock Class A eligibility: found and correct, citing p.156, which `--jev-prev` brought in.
- **Robeco's two unverified quotes are real**: the Citations API returns the line-break hyphen of "nicht-institutionelle"
  (p.22) as U+0002. `QuoteCheck` now reads control characters as a hyphen and ignores soft hyphens; the run file keeps
  the original 29/31.
- BlackRock's run reports 94k cached input tokens read and none written, although this excerpt had not been sent
  before; hence $0.20 instead of about $0.65. Not explained; check the Console bill.
